                    <p>We at ThoughtBlog are just the same as your average human being. We all have a brain which
                        allows us to think. Sometimes we all have thoughts that seem to provoke us to stop and wonder</p>
                    <p>We write about topics that including philosophy, human interaction with the environment, the
                        quest for peace, evolution of societies, critical views on modern day affairs and other such
                        critical areas. We deem them to be critical, since neglect/suppression of these critcal
                        thoughts is a true way of setting the human race up for hardships. We write about thoughts that
                        many be already be thinking of, but none wishes to talk about.</p>
                    <p>We are firm believers in the freedom of thought, and that our thoughts are a true reflection of
                        ourselves. We share our thoughts with a hope to get others to think, for true liberation may be
                        acheived only when we fully embrace all our thoughts and encourage others to think as well.</p>
